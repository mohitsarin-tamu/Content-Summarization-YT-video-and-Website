# Content-Summarization-YT-video-and-Website

- Here, I have created Streamlit application that allows users to summarize text from YouTube videos or websites using Google's `Gemma-7b-It` model.
- Users enter a URL and their GROQ API key, and the app validates the inputs.
- Depending on the URL, it loads content either from YouTube or website, then uses a prompt template to generate a 500-word summary of the content.
